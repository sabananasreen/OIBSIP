      <p id="p1">
        The Henna plant, scientifically named Lawsonia inermis is a hardy
        tropical shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6-25 feet tall. Native
        to regions like North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia, it is
        well-suited to hot, dry climates and is highly drought-resistant. The
        plant has small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink,
        which attract pollinators. Its branches are dense with oval-shaped green
        leaves, and the plant has a resilient nature, able to thrive with
        minimal water once established. The Henna plant is often cultivated for
        various purposes and is appreciated for its ornamental value as well as
        its use in traditional gardens.

      <h2 class="subheading2" style="color:darkgreen">Henna Leaf</h2>
      <p id="p2">
        The henna leaf is known for its natural dyeing properties and therapeutic benefits. These small, oval leaves contain a compound called lawsone, which releases a red-orange pigment when crushed and mixed with liquid. Traditionally, henna leaves are used to create natural hair dye, temporary skin art, and have cooling, antiseptic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Henna is popular in beauty and wellness practices, especially in South Asian and North African cultures, where it's applied for celebrations, body art, and medicinal purposes. Its natural properties make it a safe and eco-friendly alternative to synthetic dyes and treatments.
